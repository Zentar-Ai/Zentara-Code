# Debugging Tools Demonstration Script (for LLM) - JavaScript Merge Sort

This document outlines a step-by-step demonstration of runtime debugging capabilities using a buggy JavaScript Merge Sort script. The target audience for this demonstration is an LLM that will be guided through the debugging process.

## Objective

To showcase the use of various debugging concepts such as launching a debug session, setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and analyzing the call stack to identify and understand bugs in a JavaScript script, all performed by an LLM. Repair the file based on the deep understanding of the runtime behavior of the program, not based on the static analysis of the code.

## Prerequisites

- The file [`testdata/merge_sort_buggy.js`](testdata/merge_sort_buggy.js) must exist in the workspace. This file contains a Merge Sort algorithm with an intentional bug and simple assertion-based tests (using console.log for demonstration).
- The LLM must have access to and knowledge of how to use debugging tools for JavaScript.

## Demonstration Steps

### 1. Prepare the Debugging Target

**Instruction for LLM:**

Your first step is to create a copy of the script we'll be debugging. This ensures the original buggy script remains untouched for future demonstrations.

_Action:_ Copy the file [`testdata/merge_sort_buggy.js`](testdata/merge_sort_buggy.js) to a new file named [`testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js`](testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js) by using command line ' cp [original file path] [new file path ] '

### 2. Launch a Debugging Session

**Instruction for LLM:**

Now, start a debugging session for the copied JavaScript script: [`testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js`](testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js).
Configure the debugger to stop at the very beginning of the script's execution (stop on entry).

_Action:_ Launch the specified JavaScript script in a debugging session with `stopOnEntry` enabled.

### 3. Initial Run and Observing Failures

**Instruction for LLM:**

The script is designed to fail due to its bugs. After the initial stop at entry, continue program execution without any additional breakpoints. Let the program run until it finishes or hits an unhandled exception.
Report the output, including any errors or incorrect results observed from the console.log statements.

_Action:_ Continue program execution and report the results.

### 4. Iterative Debugging and Diagnosis

**(This section will be guided interactively. The LLM will use various debugging tools based on the observed errors.)**

**General Instructions for LLM for this phase:**

Based on the incorrect output from the initial run, you will now use your debugging capabilities to pinpoint the cause of a specific failure. Focus on runtime analysis. Do NOT try to fix the code by static analysis alone. The goal is to _use the debugger_ to understand _why_ it's failing.

**Example Scenario (to be adapted based on actual first incorrect output):**

Let's assume the first incorrect output is for the array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]`.

**Instruction for LLM (Example):**

It appears the output for `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]` is incorrect. Let's investigate this.

1.  Restart the debugging session for [`testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js`](testdata/merge_sort_buggy.debug.js), again stopping at the entry point.
2.  Identify the line number where the `mergeSort` function begins and set a breakpoint there.
3.  Identify the line number where `mergeSort` is called with the array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]` and set a breakpoint there.
4.  Continue execution until the breakpoint (related to the specific test case call) is hit.

_Action:_ Perform the restart and set the specified breakpoints, then continue execution.

**Instruction for LLM (Example continued):**

Now that execution is paused before calling `mergeSort` for the array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4]`:

1.  Inspect the value of the argument that will be passed to `mergeSort` (the array itself).
2.  Step into the `mergeSort` function.

_Action:_ Evaluate the relevant variables and then step into the function call.

**Instruction for LLM (Example continued):**

You are now inside the `mergeSort` function.

1.  Note the current line of execution.
2.  Step through the function line by line. As you step, observe the values of key local variables (e.g., `arr`, `middle`, `left`, `right`).
3.  Pay close attention to the recursive calls to `mergeSort` and how the `merge` function is called.
4.  When execution enters the `merge` function, step through its logic line by line. Observe the values of `left`, `right`, `result`, `leftIndex`, and `rightIndex`.
5.  Based on the execution flow and variable states observed through the debugger, identify why the `merge` function might be failing or behaving incorrectly, leading to an unsorted result.

_Action:_ Step through the code, evaluate variables, and analyze the control flow to diagnose the issue, particularly focusing on the `merge` function.

**Further Debugging Scenarios (LLM to explore as needed):**

- **Investigating `merge` function logic:** If a bug is suspected in `merge`, set breakpoints specifically within it. Step through its while loop, examine how elements are compared and added to the `result` array. Look for incorrect comparison logic or index manipulation errors by inspecting variable states.
- **Analyzing recursive calls:** When `mergeSort` calls itself, examine the `left` and `right` arrays being passed. Are they correctly split? Use the call stack to understand the depth of recursion and the state of arrays at each level.
- **Variable inspection:** Use your capability to evaluate expressions and variables extensively at critical points to understand the program's state.
- **Call stack analysis:** If an error occurs deep in recursion or within the `merge` function called from a deep recursive level, analyze the call stack to understand the sequence of calls and the state at each frame that led to the error.

### 5. Identifying a Bug (Example)

**Instruction for LLM:**

After stepping through the relevant code sections and inspecting variable states using the debugger (e.g., focusing on the `merge` function), explain the specific bug you've identified. Your explanation should be based _solely_ on the information gathered from the runtime debugging session.

_Action:_ Provide a diagnosis of a bug based on debugger information.

### 6. (Optional) Proposing a Fix and Verifying

**Instruction for LLM:**

Based on your runtime diagnosis, you might be asked to propose a minimal code change to fix the identified bug. If instructed, and if your tools allow code modification, you would then apply the fix, restart the debugging session (or relevant part of the test), and verify if the specific test case now produces the correct output.

**Note:** The primary goal of this demonstration is diagnosis using debug tools, not necessarily fixing all bugs.

## Conclusion

This demonstration should highlight how an LLM can utilize runtime debugging tools to systematically analyze code execution, inspect state, and pinpoint the root causes of errors in a JavaScript context. This is a critical capability for advanced code understanding and assistance in software development.
