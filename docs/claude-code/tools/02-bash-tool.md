# Bash Tool

## Original Function Definition

```json
{
  "description": "Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all ${PRODUCT_NAME} users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below.

## Detailed Description

The Bash tool executes shell commands in a persistent shell session with proper security measures, timeout handling, and output capture. It's designed to handle system operations, build commands, git operations, and other command-line tasks while enforcing security and best practices.

## Key Features

1. **Persistent Shell Session**: Commands execute in a consistent environment
2. **Timeout Support**: Default 2 minutes, configurable up to 10 minutes
3. **Output Truncation**: Limits output to 30,000 characters
4. **Path Quoting**: Handles spaces in file paths correctly
5. **Security Restrictions**: Prevents dangerous operations
6. **Git Integration**: Special handling for commits and PRs

## Usage Guidelines

### Directory Management
- **Prefer absolute paths** over using `cd`
- **Verify directories** with LS tool before creating subdirectories
- **Quote paths with spaces**: Use double quotes around paths

### Command Restrictions
**MUST Avoid:**
- `find` â†’ Use Glob tool instead
- `grep` â†’ Use Grep tool (or `rg` if absolutely necessary)
- `cat`, `head`, `tail` â†’ Use Read tool
- `ls` â†’ Use LS tool

**Cannot Use:**
- Interactive commands (`vim`, `nano`, `less`)
- System commands (`sudo`, `shutdown`, `mount`)
- Interactive git flags (`-i` flags)

### Multiple Commands
- Use `;` or `&&` to chain commands
- Don't use newlines except in quoted strings
- Batch parallel operations when possible

## Examples

### Basic Commands
```typescript
// Simple command
await Bash({
  command: "pwd",
  description: "Shows current directory"
})

// With timeout
await Bash({
  command: "npm test",
  description: "Runs test suite",
  timeout: 300000  // 5 minutes
})

// Multiple commands
await Bash({
  command: "npm install && npm run build",
  description: "Install dependencies and build"
})
```

### Path Handling
```typescript
// Correct - paths with spaces quoted
await Bash({
  command: 'cd "/Users/john/My Documents" && pwd',
  description: "Navigate to documents folder"
})

// Correct - using absolute paths
await Bash({
  command: "pytest /home/user/project/tests",
  description: "Run tests with absolute path"
})

// Incorrect - would fail with spaces
// cd /Users/john/My Documents
```

### Git Operations

#### Creating a Commit
```typescript
// Step 1: Check status (run in parallel)
const [status, diff, log] = await Promise.all([
  Bash({ command: "git status", description: "Check git status" }),
  Bash({ command: "git diff", description: "Show unstaged changes" }),
  Bash({ command: "git log --oneline -10", description: "Recent commits" })
])

// Step 2: Stage and commit
await Bash({
  command: `git add . && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

  description: "Create git commit"
})
```

#### Creating a Pull Request
```typescript
// Step 1: Analyze branch (run in parallel)
const [status, diff, tracking, history] = await Promise.all([
  Bash({ command: "git status", description: "Check status" }),
  Bash({ command: "git diff", description: "Show changes" }),
  Bash({ command: "git branch -vv", description: "Check tracking" }),
  Bash({ command: "git log main..HEAD --oneline", description: "Branch commits" })
])

// Step 2: Push and create PR
await Bash({
  command: "git push -u origin feature-branch",
  description: "Push branch to remote"
})

await Bash({
  command: `gh pr create --title "Add user authentication" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Build and Test Commands
```typescript
// Node.js project
await Bash({
  command: "npm install && npm run lint && npm test",
  description: "Install, lint, and test"
})

// Python project
await Bash({
  command: "pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m pytest",
  description: "Install dependencies and run tests"
})

// Check specific test file
await Bash({
  command: "python -m pytest tests/test_auth.py -v",
  description: "Run auth tests verbosely"
})
```

## Special Git Workflows

### Commit Workflow
1. **Always run in parallel**: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
2. **Analyze changes** for sensitive data
3. **Use HEREDOC** for commit messages
4. **Include attribution**: Add Claude Code footer
5. **Handle pre-commit hooks**: Retry once if hooks modify files

### Pull Request Workflow
1. **Analyze branch state** with parallel commands
2. **Check all commits**, not just the latest
3. **Push with `-u` flag** if needed
4. **Use `gh pr create`** with structured body
5. **Return PR URL** to user

## Error Handling

The tool handles various error scenarios:
- **Command not found**: Returns exit code 127
- **Permission denied**: Returns exit code 126
- **Timeout**: Returns partial output with timeout indication
- **Non-zero exit**: Returns stderr and exit code

## Security Considerations

1. **No privilege escalation**: No `sudo` or system commands
2. **Workspace boundaries**: Operations limited to workspace
3. **No interactive mode**: All commands must be non-interactive
4. **Environment filtering**: Limited environment variables
5. **Command validation**: Dangerous patterns blocked

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate tools**: Don't use Bash for file operations when dedicated tools exist
2. **Batch operations**: Run independent commands in parallel
3. **Handle errors**: Check exit codes and stderr
4. **Quote properly**: Always quote paths with spaces
5. **Be explicit**: Use absolute paths when possible
6. **Add descriptions**: Clear 5-10 word descriptions help with debugging

## Common Patterns

### Running Tests
```typescript
// Discover test command
await Bash({
  command: "npm run | grep test",
  description: "Find test scripts"
})

// Run with coverage
await Bash({
  command: "npm test -- --coverage",
  description: "Run tests with coverage"
})
```

### Environment Info
```typescript
// Check versions
await Bash({
  command: "node --version && npm --version",
  description: "Check Node and npm versions"
})

// Check environment
await Bash({
  command: "echo $NODE_ENV",
  description: "Check Node environment"
})
```

### File Operations (when necessary)
```typescript
// Create directory structure
await Bash({
  command: "mkdir -p src/components/auth",
  description: "Create auth component directory"
})

// Check file permissions
await Bash({
  command: "ls -la src/config",
  description: "List config with permissions"
})
```
