# Zentara Code â€” AI Coding Assistant for VS Code

Zentara Code turns chat instructions into precise, auditable changes in your codebase. It is optimized for speed, safety, and correctness through parallel execution, LSP semantics, and integrated runtime debugging.

## What Makes Zentara Different

- **Parallel subagents**: Independent workers run simultaneously with strict scope separation, optâ€‘in write permissions, and perâ€‘agent timeouts for high throughput without conflicts.
- **Integrated LSP tools**: Operations use the Language Server Protocol for file structure, semantic references, call hierarchy, safe renames, workspaceâ€‘wide symbol discovery, and targeted snippets.
- **Runtime debugging**: Launch, control, and inspect debug sessions from tasks to reproduce, instrument, step, and validate before concluding changes.

## Getting Started

Zentara Code is a VS Code extension. Here's how you can get started:

**1. Install from VS Code Marketplace (Recommended for Users)**

- Install latest VS Code. The extension is build for VS Code 1.96.4 and later
- Open VS Code.
- Install the necessary language extension and language debugger extension. For example for Python, just install Microsoft Python extension, it will automatically install debugpy debugger. Check the debugger manually on any of your script to make sure it works.
- **Configure `launch.json` (Optional but Recommended):** For a more streamlined experience, you can define debug configurations in your `.vscode/launch.json` file. This allows you to launch complex debugging scenarios with a simple name (e.g., "Run Extension", "Debug Current Test File"). You can then instruct Zentara to use these configurations directly, e.g., "Zentara, launch the debugger with the 'Run Extension' config". For TypeScript files, install npm and tsx (by running `npm install -g tsx`).
-  For Zentara Code to effectively debug Python projects, especially those using Conda environments or specific `pytest` installations, ensure the correct Python interpreter is configured in your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
	"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python"
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/conda/env/bin/python` with the actual path to your Python interpreter.
- For python pytest tests: install pytest. If you would like to install pytest in a conda enviroment,remember to point the python interperter in settings.json(see the above point) 
- Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
- Search for "Zentara Code".
- Click "Install".
- Once installed, Zentara Code will be available to assist you.

**2. Build and Install from Source (For Developers/Contributors)**

If you want to contribute or run the latest development version:

- **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Zentar-Ai/Zentara-Code.git
    cd zentara-code
    ```

- **Install dependencies:**
  This project uses pnpm. Ensure you have Node.js npm , pnpm installed.
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
- **Build the extension:**

    ```sh
    pnpm vsix
    ```

    This will typically compile the TypeScript code and package the extension into a `.vsix` file in a `bin/` directory.

- **Install the .vsix file in VS Code:**
    1.  Go to the Extensions view in VS Code.
    2.  Click the "..." (More Actions) menu in the top-right corner of the Extensions view.
    3.  Select "Install from VSIX..."
    4.  Navigate to and select the generated `.vsix` file.


## Workflow Model

- **Plan**: Zentara decomposes your request into small, independent steps and proposes safe execution order.
- **Approvals**: Potentially impactful actions (file writes, network, long operations) require explicit approval.
- **Execute**: Steps are distributed to parallel subagents when independent to reduce wallâ€‘clock time.
- **Analyze**: Code understanding is LSPâ€‘first (document symbols â†’ usages â†’ call hierarchy â†’ targeted snippets).
- **Verify**: Integrated debugging provides breakpoints, stepping, state inspection, and evaluation to confirm behavior.

## Core Capabilities

### Code Understanding & Analysis
- File and module structure analysis via LSP document symbols
- True semantic usages across the workspace (not text matches)
- Caller/callee relationships via call hierarchy
- Targeted code snippets for precise context
- 25+ LSP tools for semantic code intelligence

### Parallel Task Execution
- Independent subagents with isolated contexts
- Scope separation to prevent conflicts
- Predefined agents for common workflows (code review, bug investigation)
- General subagents for custom tasks
- Available across all modes for maximum flexibility

### Code Generation & Editing
- Feature implementation, bug fixes, refactors
- Safe, reviewable diffs with minimal surface area
- Styleâ€‘ and frameworkâ€‘aware changes
- Safe refactoring with semantic rename and impact analysis

### Runtime Debugging
- Complete debug session management (launch, restart, quit)
- Execution control (continue, step, jump, until)
- Comprehensive breakpoint management
- State inspection (stack traces, variables, evaluation)
- 35+ debugging operations for thorough validation

### Documentation & Testing
- Generate READMEs, API docs, and test scaffolds
- Propose focused unit/integration tests

### Project Automation
- Script generation, config updates, and task runners

## Parallel Subagents (Performance and Safety)

- **Isolation**: Each worker runs with its own context and is assigned nonâ€‘overlapping scope (files, features, layers).
- **Permissions**: Writes are optâ€‘in and constrained to allowed paths; readâ€‘only by default.
- **Timeouts**: Perâ€‘agent execution is timeâ€‘bounded to prevent runaway tasks.
- **Determinism**: Plans enumerate inputs/outputs; results are merged with conflict avoidance.
- **Observability**: You can inspect each subtask's plan and results before moving on.

*â†’ See [Subagent System Guide](docs/subagent-tool-overview.md) for advanced patterns and best practices*

## LSPâ€‘First Code Intelligence (Accuracy)

- **Structure**: Get symbol trees without reading entire files.
- **Usages**: Find real references, not text matches.
- **Call graph**: See who calls what to understand flows and side effects.
- **Safety**: Use semantic information to avoid dangerous edits and hidden couplings.
- **Scope**: Ask for just the code that matters via targeted snippets to reduce noise.

*â†’ See [LSP Tools Guide](docs/lsp-tools-overview.md) for complete tool reference and workflows*

## Runtime Debugging (Validation)

- **Control**: Launch sessions, continue, step, and stop from within Zentara tasks.
- **Breakpoints**: Add, remove, enable/disable, conditional, and temporary breakpoints.
- **Inspection**: View stack traces, active frame variables, arguments, and source context.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate expressions and run statements in the current context where supported.
- **Integration**: Use debugging during or after code edits to verify correctness before finalizing.

*â†’ See [Debugging Guide](docs/Debugging.md) for detailed operations and troubleshooting*





## Prompting Tips

- **Be goalâ€‘oriented**: describe the outcome, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- **Provide guardrails**: performance budgets, API boundaries, style preferences.
- **Embrace iteration**: accept partial progress and refine.
- **Let Zentara plan**: approve or edit its proposed steps rather than dictating lineâ€‘level changes.
