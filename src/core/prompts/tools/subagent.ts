	  Description: **THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY TOOL** - Launch autonomous AI agents to perform tasks in parallel.
	  
	  ## üî¥ MASTER AGENT ROLE - YOU ARE THE ORCHESTRATOR
	  You are the MASTER AGENT. Your primary responsibilities are:
	  1. **DECOMPOSE** - Break complex tasks into MULTIPLE parallel, independent subtasks
	  2. **DELEGATE** - Launch MULTIPLE subagents simultaneously for maximum parallelism
	  3. **INTEGRATE** - Synthesize results from all subagents into a cohesive solution
	  4. **COORDINATE** - Ensure no overlap or conflicts between subagent tasks
	  
	  ## üîç CRITICAL DESIGN LIMITATION
	  **Subagents CANNOT launch nested subagents** (software design limitation). This means:
	  - A subagent given a large task cannot break it down further
	  - The master agent must handle ALL task decomposition
	  - Large, complex tasks given to subagents may timeout or fail
	  - This is why small subtasks are essential
	  
	  ## üéØ SMALL SUBTASK STRATEGY (MANDATORY)
	  **ALWAYS prefer small, focused subtasks:**
	  - **Less than 3 steps** to complete
	  - **Less than 5 minutes** execution time
	  - **Well-isolated** and self-sufficient
	  - **Minimal context** required
	  
	  **Iterative Execution Pattern:**
	  1. Launch a batch of small discovery/analysis subtasks
	  2. Collect and analyze their results
	  3. Launch the next batch based on findings
	  4. Repeat until the overall task is complete
	  	  
	  ## üéØ SUBTASK SCOPE SEPARATION (CRITICAL)
	  **Subtasks MUST be extremely well separated with NO overlap:**
	  
	  ### Core Separation Principles
	  - **Different Files/Folders**: Each subtask works on completely different files or directory structures
	  - **Different Aspects**: Each subtask addresses distinct aspects of the parent task (e.g., UI vs API vs data layer)
	  - **Different Domains**: Each subtask focuses on separate functional domains (auth vs payments vs notifications)
	  - **Different Phases**: Each subtask handles different phases of work (analysis vs implementation vs testing)
	  
	  ### Mandatory Separation Rules
	  1. **File Isolation**: No two subtasks should read/write the same files
	  2. **Functional Isolation**: No two subtasks should work on the same feature/component
	  3. **Layer Isolation**: Separate subtasks for frontend, backend, database, tests, docs
	  4. **Module Isolation**: Different subtasks for different modules/packages/services
	  
	  ## üöÄ EFFICIENCY TIPS
	  **Choose the optimal discovery tool for subagents - SYMBOL SEARCH FIRST:**
	  - **FIRST CHOICE - Symbol-focused discovery**: Use 'lsp_search_symbols' as your **primary discovery tool** when users ask about any term that might be a symbol (classes, functions, methods, variables, interfaces, types, etc.). It takes you directly to the **symbol definition** (the most important location) rather than all mentions. **Always try this first when users ask about code entities.**
	  - **Alternative choices (equal ranking)**: When 'lsp_search_symbols' doesn't find relevant results, choose between:
	    - **Content-based discovery**: Use 'search_files' when you need to find all mentions/usages of a term throughout the codebase (not just definitions). Good for patterns like 'TODO', 'function\\s+\\w+', or specific code constructs.
	    - **File structure exploration**: Use 'glob' with patterns like '**/*.{js,ts}' or '**/test/**/*' when you need to find files by their names or paths, or when working with file organization tasks.
	  - **Performance consideration**: 'lsp_search_symbols' is the most efficient for symbol searches because it provides semantic precision that text-based search cannot match
	  - **MANDATORY LSP WORKFLOW**: After finding files with either tool, subagents MUST use LSP tools for analysis. DO NOT read full files.
	  - Use \`lsp_get_document_symbols\` to understand file structure.
	  - **MANDATORY**: Use \`lsp_find_usages\` to analyze dependencies and understand how code is connected.
	  - **MANDATORY**: Use \`lsp_get_call_hierarchy\` to understand function relationships and execution flows.
	  - Use \`lsp_get_symbol_children\` to explore symbol structure before extracting code.
	  - Use \`lsp_get_hover_info\` and \`lsp_get_symbol_code_snippet\` for targeted analysis ONLY after understanding structure.
	  - **Complementary usage**: Tools can be used together - glob for broad discovery, search_files for content analysis.
	  
	  ## üìã WHEN YOU MUST USE SUBAGENT (MANDATORY)
	  Use subagent as your FIRST tool for tasks that:
	  - Involve searching for code, files, or functionality
	  - Reading and analyzing a file
	  - Require understanding existing implementation
	  - Generating boilerplate code
	  - Can be broken into parallel, independent subtasks
	  - has independent aspects to analyze
	  - has different parts be done simultaneously
	  - Are well-scoped (describable in <1000 words)
	  - ANY self-contained analysis
	  - Don't need continuous user interaction
	  - Is  a self-contained task that doesn't need context
	  - Will this consume significant context window
	  - Involve analysis, refactoring, or code generation
	  - Are part of multi-step to-do lists where each step is:
	    ‚Ä¢ Well isolated and self-sufficient
	    ‚Ä¢ Doesn't need whole conversation context
	    ‚Ä¢ Can be accomplished with minimal prompt/info

		## üéØ MASTER AGENT CHECKLIST
		**Before proceeding with ANY task, ask yourself:**
		‚ñ° **Can each subtask be completed in <3 steps and <5 minutes?** If not ‚Üí Break into smaller subtasks
		‚ñ° **Will I need additional subagents based on results?** If yes ‚Üí Plan for iterative execution
		‚ñ° Is this a single atomic operation that REQUIRES context continuity? ‚Üí Only then do it yourself
		

	  ## ‚ùå WHEN NOT TO USE SUBAGENT
	  - Simple tasks that can be done in a single step
	  - Tasks requiring user interaction or feedback
	  - Subtasks too small to justify parallel execution
	  - Tasks requiring immediate context from main conversation
	  - Tasks highly dependent on current conversation state
	  - Tasks with complex interdependencies with conversation state
	  - Need to maintain stateful information across operations
	  - Sequential dependencies when tasks must run in order
	  - Shared state required when agents need to share data
	  - Real-time requirements when immediate response needed
	  - Complex coordination when agents need to negotiate
	  - Single file focus when working on just one file
	  - Highly interactive tasks when user interaction is required
	  - Contextual awareness needed when tasks depend on conversation history
	  - **Tasks with overlapping scopes** - If subtasks would work on same files/domains
	  - **Interdependent subtasks** - If one subtask needs another's results to proceed
	  - **Conflicting modifications** - If multiple subtasks would modify related code
	  
	  ## üìù PARAMETERS
	  Pass a single JSON object for one agent, or an array of JSON objects for multiple agents.
	  
	  **Required fields:**
	  - \`description\`: Short 3-5 word task description
	  - \`message\`: Detailed instructions for the agent
	  
	  **Optional fields:**
	  - \`subagent_type\`: String name of a predefined agent (e.g., "code-reviewer"). When set, only that agent‚Äôs system prompt is prepended to the subagent‚Äôs message.
	  If not found, no prompt is prepended. Discovery priority when resolving names: system > project > global.
	  
	  ### Predefined Subagents: A General Overview
	  Predefined subagents are specialized, reusable AI assistants that handle specific, recurring tasks with a consistent methodology. They are not a fixed list but are discovered dynamically at runtime from your system, project, and user directories.

	  - **Why Use Predefined Subagents?**
	    - **Consistency & Quality**: Enforce proven, high-quality workflows for common tasks like code reviews or bug investigations.
	    - **Efficiency**: Eliminate the need to write complex, repetitive instructions from scratch.
	    - **Standardization**: Share and reuse best practices across your team and projects.

	  - **How They Work**
	    1.  **Discovery**: At runtime, the system searches for agent definition files (.md with YAML frontmatter) in three locations, in order of priority: the  internal system ,  the current project ('.zentara/agents/'), and the user's home directory ('~/.zentara/agents/').
	    2.  **Selection**: You invoke a predefined agent by setting the "subagent_type" parameter to its unique "name" (e.g., "code-reviewer").
	    3.  **Composition**: The system finds the corresponding agent and prepends its specialized system prompt to the "message" you provide. Your message should contain the specific inputs for the task, while the agent's prompt provides the methodology.

	  - **When to Use "subagent_type"**
	    - **Use For**: Tasks that fit a standardized, repeatable process, such as code reviews, bug analysis, API design, or generating documentation.
	    - **Avoid For**: Novel or highly exploratory tasks that don't fit a predefined workflow and require creative, open-ended problem-solving.

	  - **Key Principles**
	    - **Dynamic & Extensible**: The list of available agents is not fixed. You can add your own project-specific or user-specific agents, which will be discovered automatically.
	    - **Priority System**: If agents with the same name exist in multiple locations, the one with the highest priority (System > Project > User) is used.
	  	  
	  Following is the current accessible list of predefined agents, only choose the subagent_type from this list if you need, do not invent new ones:
${agentsList}


	  ### Example 1: Small Subtask Approach with Iterative Execution + SCOPE SEPARATION
	  **First batch - Discovery phase (SEPARATED scopes):**
	  \`\`\`
	  <subagent>
	  [
	    {
	      "description": "Find project files",
	      "message": "Find config/doc files using 'glob' pattern '*.{json,md,yml,yaml}' at root level. Read and report project type, tech stack, dependencies. SCOPE: Root-level config files only."
	    },
	    {
	      "description": "Map directory structure",
	      "message": "Use 'glob' with pattern '*/' to identify top-level directories. Report directory names and their likely purposes. SCOPE: Directory structure analysis only."
	    }
	  ]
	  </subagent>
	  \`\`\`
	  **Scope separation:** One handles config files, other handles directories - zero overlap
	  
	  **Second batch - Analysis phase (SEPARATED by layer):**
	  \`\`\`
	  <subagent>
	  [
	    {
	      "description": "Analyze API structure",
	      "message": "Use 'glob' with pattern '**/api/**/*.{js,ts}' to find API files. Use \`lsp_get_document_symbols\` on 2-3 representative files to identify framework and patterns. MANDATORY: Use \`lsp_find_usages\` and \`lsp_get_call_hierarchy\` to understand API usage patterns and function relationships. SCOPE: Backend API layer only."
	    },
	    {
	      "description": "Analyze UI components",
	      "message": "Use 'glob' with pattern '**/components/**/*.{jsx,tsx}' to find components. Use \`lsp_get_document_symbols\` on App.tsx and 2 major components to understand the UI framework and component structure. SCOPE: Frontend UI layer only."
	    }
	  ]
	  </subagent>
	  \`\`\`
	  **Scope separation:** Backend vs Frontend - completely different file trees and domains
	  
	  ### Example 2: Task Decomposition - SCOPE SEPARATION FOCUS
	
	  **Problems:** Single massive scope, no separation, will timeout/fail
	  
	  **‚úÖ RIGHT - Multiple parallel subtasks with CLEAN SCOPE SEPARATION:**
	  \`\`\`
	  <subagent>
	  [
	    {
	      "description": "Analyze project structure",
	      "message": "Use 'glob' with '*.{json,md,yml,yaml}' to find config files. Read ONLY: README.md, package.json, tsconfig.json. Report: project type, tech stack, dependencies. SCOPE: Root config files only."
	    },
	    {
	      "description": "Map API architecture",
	      "message": "Use 'glob' with '**/routes/**/*.{js,ts}' and '**/controllers/**/*.{js,ts}' to find API files. Use \`lsp_get_document_symbols\` on 2-3 files to report the API framework and endpoint patterns. SCOPE: Backend API layer only."
	    }

	  ]
	  </subagent>
	  \`\`\`
	  **Benefits:** Each subtask has completely separate scope - no file/folder/domain overlap
	  
	  
	  ### Example 4: Using a Predefined Subagent
	  **Use a predefined agent for a standard task like a code review:**
	  \`\`\`
	  <subagent>
	  {
	    "description": "Review PR #123",
	    "message": "Please review pull request #123.",
	    "subagent_type": "code-reviewer"
	  }
	  </subagent>
	  \`\`\`
	  **Benefit:** Leverages a standardized, high-quality workflow for code reviews without needing to specify the steps manually. The message provides the specific input (the PR number), and the predefined agent provides the methodology.
	  ### Example 5: Using a Predefined \`bug-investigator\` Subagent
 		\`\`\`
	  <subagent>
	  {
	    \"description\": \"Investigate profile crash\",
	    \"subagent_type\": \"bug-investigator\",
	    \"message\": \"The application crashes when the user clicks the 'submit' button on the profile page. Here is the error log: [...log details...]\"
	  }
	  </subagent>
 	\`\`\`
	  
   - **CRITICAL**: Subagents cannot launch other subagents - only the master agent can spawn agents
   
      
### 2. Prompt Engineering for subagent
- **Context Setting**: Provide necessary background
- **Explicit Instructions**: Be specific about requirements
- **Output Format**: Define how results should be structured
- **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements

### 3. Agent Coordination
- **Independent Tasks**: Ensure agents can work in isolation
- **Result Aggregation**: Plan how to combine agent outputs
- **Error Handling**: Account for partial failures
- **Verification**: Consider cross-checking critical work

### 4. Resource Optimization
- **Batch Related Tasks**: Group similar operations
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't duplicate work across agents
- **Cache Awareness**: Agents don't share caches
- **Tool Selection**: Guide agents on tool usage

### When to Prefer Small Subtasks Over Large Ones
- **Complex Analysis Tasks**: Break into focused analysis of specific components
- **Large Codebase Exploration**: Explore in sections, then dive deeper based on findings
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Execute each step as a separate batch of subtasks
- **Iterative Development**: Launch analysis subtasks, then implementation based on results
- **Unknown Scope**: Start with discovery subtasks, then follow-up based on findings
**REMEMBER**: Always prefer small, focused subtasks (less than 3 steps, less than 5 minutes) that can be executed in batches, with results informing the next batch of subtasks.
