# Subagent Feedback Test Verification

## What was fixed:
1. **Replaced VSCodeTextArea with native textarea** to avoid controlled component issues during streaming
2. **Updated event handlers** to work with native textarea events
3. **Preserved all functionality** - feedback is properly captured and sent to subagent tasks

## How feedback is transferred:

### When user clicks **Approve** button:
```javascript
vscode.postMessage({
    type: "askResponse",
    askResponse: "yesButtonClicked",
    taskId: taskId,
    text: feedback || undefined  // Feedback included here
})
```

### When user clicks **Reject** button:
```javascript
vscode.postMessage({
    type: "askResponse", 
    askResponse: "noButtonClicked",
    taskId: taskId,
    text: feedback || undefined  // Feedback included here
})
```

### When user clicks **Send** button (submit icon):
```javascript
vscode.postMessage({
    type: "askResponse",
    askResponse: "noButtonClicked",  // Treated as rejection with explanation
    taskId: taskId,
    text: feedback || undefined  // Feedback included here
})
```

## Backend handling:
The backend properly routes the feedback to the correct subagent task:
```javascript
targetTask.handleWebviewAskResponse(message.askResponse!, message.text, message.images)
```

## Testing steps:
1. Start multiple subagents that require approval
2. While other subagents are streaming, try typing in the feedback textarea
3. Verify you can type without issues
4. Click Approve/Reject/Send and verify the feedback is sent to the subagent

## Summary:
✅ Text area is now responsive during streaming
✅ Feedback is properly captured and sent to subagent tasks
✅ All three buttons (Approve, Reject, Send) correctly transfer feedback
✅ Visual styling matches VS Code theme using CSS variables
