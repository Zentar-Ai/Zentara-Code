# Logging Suggestions to Diagnose Missing `_text` Field

This document outlines suggested logging points to help diagnose why the `_text` field (intended to carry JSON parameters for debug tools) is not being correctly populated when the `debugTool.ts` handler is invoked.

The core problem is that the JSON string provided as text content within a tool's XML tag (e.g., `<debug_launch>{JSON_STRING}</debug_launch>`) does not appear in `block.params._text` inside `debugTool.ts`.

## Suggested Logging Points:

To trace the lifecycle of this text content and identify where it's lost or mishandled, consider adding logging at these stages:

### 1. Initial Raw XML Reception

*   **Location:** The earliest point in the extension code where the raw XML string from the LLM is received, before any parsing.
*   **What to Log:** The complete, raw XML string.
    *   Example: `console.log("[Raw XML Receiver] Received:", rawXmlString);`
*   **Purpose:** To establish a baseline of the exact data the extension's parsing logic begins with. This confirms the JSON string is present in the raw input.

### 2. XML Parsing Stage (Most Critical)

*   **Location:** Within the function/method that parses the raw XML string into a JavaScript object structure.
*   **What to Log (Input to Parser):** The specific XML segment (the tool call itself) being fed into the XML parsing function/library.
    *   Example: `console.log("[XML Parser] Parsing segment:", xmlSegmentToParse);`
*   **What to Log (Output from Parser):** The direct, structured JavaScript object that the XML parser produces from that XML segment.
    *   Example: `const parsedObject = specificXmlParser.parse(xmlSegmentToParse); console.log("[XML Parser] Direct parser output:", JSON.stringify(parsedObject, null, 2));`
*   **Key Investigation:**
    *   How does `parsedObject` represent the text content found directly within an XML element (e.g., the JSON string inside `<debug_launch>...</debug_launch>`)?
    *   Does the parser create a property (like `_text`, `#text`, `value`, or another convention) in `parsedObject` to hold this text content? Or is this text content discarded, ignored, or placed in an unexpected location by the current parser configuration?
*   **Purpose:** This stage is where the `_text` field (or the data that *should* become `_text`) is effectively "formed" or "lost". If the parser doesn't extract and appropriately key this text content, `debugTool.ts` will not receive it.

### 3. Data Transformation Stage (If any, between XML parsing and `debugTool.ts`)

*   **Location:** If the direct output from the XML parser (from stage 2) undergoes further processing, mapping, or transformation before becoming the final `block.params` object that `debugTool.ts` expects.
*   **What to Log:** The object *before* and *after* each significant transformation or mapping step.
    *   Example (before transformation): `console.log("[Data Transformer] Object before transformation:", JSON.stringify(objectFromParser, null, 2));`
    *   Example (after transformation): `console.log("[Data Transformer] Object after transformation:", JSON.stringify(transformedObject, null, 2));`
*   **Purpose:** To check if the text content, even if correctly extracted by the parser under some key (e.g., `parserOutput.someTextKey`), is inadvertently dropped or incorrectly re-mapped during these intermediate steps before it's finalized into the `block.params._text` structure.

### 4. Final Input to `debugTool.ts`

*   **Location:** Immediately before the `debugTool` function in `src/core/tools/debugTool.ts` is invoked.
*   **What to Log:** The complete `block.params` object.
    *   Example: `console.log("[Tool Dispatcher] Passing to debugTool, block.params:", JSON.stringify(block.params, null, 2));`
*   **Purpose:** This confirms the final state of `params` that `debugTool.ts` actually works with. Comparing this log with logs from stage 2 and 3 will help pinpoint exactly where `_text` was lost or why it's not populated. (User-provided logs have already shown `_text` is missing here).

## Summary of Hypothesis

The primary hypothesis is that the XML parsing component (Stage 2) is not configured or behaving in a way that extracts the text content of an XML element and assigns it to an `_text` key in its output object, which is the format now expected by `debugTool.ts` following the recent refactoring (commit `3c920b71fecb66419d48367ce1c22d00263e059b`).
