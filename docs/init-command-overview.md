# The `/init` Command: Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction & Overview

The `/init` command is a powerful built-in slash command in Zentara that serves as the **gateway to AI-assisted development**. Its primary purpose is to analyze codebases and create concise `AGENTS.md` files that provide AI assistants with essential, project-specific information needed to be immediately productive.

Unlike traditional documentation tools that capture everything, `/init` focuses exclusively on **non-obvious, project-specific patterns** that AI assistants cannot easily infer from standard code analysis. This makes it an invaluable tool for bootstrapping AI knowledge in new projects.

## Core Functionality

### Smart Documentation Creation

The `/init` command creates intelligent documentation in two key locations:

1. **Project Root**: Creates or enhances `AGENTS.md` in the project root with essential project guidance
2. **Mode-Specific Files**: Generates targeted files in `.zentara/rules-*/AGENTS.md` for different Zentara modes

The command focuses only on information discovered by actually reading and analyzing files, avoiding obvious patterns that AI can deduce independently.

### Existing File Enhancement

When `AGENTS.md` files already exist, `/init` intelligently:
- Removes obvious information that clutters the documentation
- Adds newly discovered non-obvious patterns and conventions
- Results in shorter, more focused documentation that's actually useful

### Multi-AI Integration

The command creates unified documentation that works across different AI tools:
- Incorporates rules from other AI assistants (Cursor, Claude, Copilot)
- Creates consistent guidance for all AI tools in the development workflow
- Ensures knowledge sharing across the entire AI ecosystem

## Technical Architecture

### Processing Flow

The `/init` command follows a sophisticated AI-driven processing pipeline:

1. **Frontend Detection**: The UI detects the `/init` pattern and provides intelligent autocomplete
2. **Backend Validation**: The backend validates command existence and performs text replacement
3. **AI Processing**: The AI receives the full command content as a natural language prompt
4. **Tool Selection**: AI selects appropriate tools from 80+ available options based on project context
5. **Execution**: Comprehensive analysis workflow using multiple specialized tools

### Priority System

Commands follow a clear priority hierarchy:
- **Project Commands** (`.zentara/commands/`) override global and built-in commands
- **Global Commands** (`~/.zentara/commands/`) override built-in commands only
- **Built-in Commands** provide system defaults and core functionality

### AI-Driven Execution

Unlike traditional CLI tools, `/init` uses advanced AI reasoning:
- **No Rigid Parsing**: Uses natural language processing instead of strict parameter parsing
- **Context-Aware**: Tool selection adapts dynamically to project structure and type
- **Adaptive Execution**: The same command executes differently based on project characteristics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Simply type `/init` in the Zentara chat interface:

```
/init
```

The command will automatically:
- Analyze your project structure
- Identify key patterns and conventions
- Generate appropriate `AGENTS.md` files
- Provide a summary of what was discovered

### Project-Specific Outcomes

**React/TypeScript Project:**
```markdown
# AGENTS.md (Generated)

## Component Patterns
- Components use Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- State management via Zustand with TypeScript interfaces
- API calls use React Query with custom hooks pattern

## Non-obvious Conventions
- Error boundaries wrap all route components
- Custom hook naming: `use[Domain][Action]` pattern
- Test files co-located with components in `__tests__` folders
```

**Node.js Backend Project:**
```markdown
# AGENTS.md (Generated)

## Architecture Patterns
- Domain-driven design with bounded contexts
- Event sourcing for user actions
- Custom middleware for request validation

## Database Conventions
- Migrations use timestamp prefixes
- Models extend BaseEntity with audit fields
- Soft deletes implemented via `deleted_at` column
```

### Before/After Enhancement

**Before (Obvious Information):**
```markdown
# AGENTS.md
- This is a TypeScript project
- Uses npm for package management
- Has a src/ directory for source code
```

**After `/init` Enhancement:**
```markdown
# AGENTS.md
- Custom barrel exports in index.ts files follow domain boundaries
- Environment-specific configs loaded via `config/[env].json` pattern
- Database migrations require both up/down methods with transaction wrapping
```

### Command Definition Structure

The `/init` command is defined as a built-in command with:
- **Name**: `init`

## Best Practices

### When to Use `/init`

**Ideal Scenarios:**
- Starting work on a new project or codebase
- Onboarding new team members to existing projects
- After major architectural changes or refactoring
- When switching between different types of projects
- Before beginning complex development tasks

**Timing Recommendations:**
- Run `/init` as the first command in any new project
- Re-run after significant codebase changes
- Use periodically to refresh and update project knowledge

### Maximizing Effectiveness

**Preparation Steps:**
1. Ensure your project has a clear structure and organization
2. Include representative examples of your coding patterns
3. Have configuration files and documentation in place
4. Consider running after major dependency updates

**Follow-up Actions:**
1. Review the generated `AGENTS.md` files for accuracy
2. Add any missing project-specific context manually
3. Share the documentation with team members
4. Update as project patterns evolve

### Common Patterns and Recommendations

**Project Organization:**
- Keep configuration files in the project root
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Maintain clear separation between different architectural layers

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Let `/init` handle the technical patterns and conventions
- Manually add business logic and domain-specific context
- Keep the generated files updated as the project evolves

**Team Collaboration:**
- Run `/init` on shared codebases to ensure consistent AI guidance
- Include generated `AGENTS.md` files in version control
- Use the documentation as part of code review processes

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Project Commands

You can override the built-in `/init` behavior by creating project-specific commands:

1. Create `.zentara/commands/init.md` in your project root
2. Define custom analysis instructions specific to your project
3. The custom command will take priority over the built-in version

### Integration with CI/CD

Consider integrating `/init` into your development workflow:
- Run as part of onboarding scripts for new developers
- Include in project setup documentation
- Use to validate project structure and conventions

### Multi-Repository Projects

For complex projects spanning multiple repositories:
- Run `/init` in each repository to capture local patterns
- Create a master `AGENTS.md` that references sub-project documentation
- Use consistent conventions across all repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command Not Found:**
- Ensure you're using the latest version of Zentara
- Check that slash commands are enabled in your configuration

**Incomplete Analysis:**
- Verify that your project has sufficient code and structure
- Ensure configuration files are present and accessible
- Check that file permissions allow reading project files

**Generated Documentation Too Generic:**
- Add more specific patterns and conventions to your codebase
- Include representative examples of your coding style
- Consider manually enhancing the generated documentation
