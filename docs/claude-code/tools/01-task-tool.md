## Original Function Definition

```json
{
	"description": "Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, exit_plan_mode, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, mcp__ide__getDiagnostics, mcp__ide__executeCode. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.\n\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\n- If you are searching for a keyword like \"config\" or \"logger\", or for questions like \"which file does X?\", the Agent tool is strongly recommended\n\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Writing code and running bash commands (use other tools for that)\n- Other tasks that are not related to searching for a keyword or file\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

## Detailed Description

The Task tool launches an autonomous agent that can perform complex search and research tasks using multiple tools. It's designed for scenarios where you need to explore the codebase thoroughly but aren't sure exactly where to look.

## When to Use

### Strongly Recommended For:

- Searching for keywords like "config", "logger", "handler", "middleware"
- Answering questions like "which file implements X?", "where is Y defined?"
- Open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds of exploration
- Understanding code architecture or patterns across multiple files
- Finding all usages or implementations of a concept

### Do NOT Use For:

- Reading a specific file when you know the path (use `Read`)
- Finding class definitions like "class Foo" (use `Glob`)
- Searching within 2-3 specific files (use `Read`)
- Writing code or executing commands (use appropriate direct tools)
- Tasks unrelated to searching or research

## Available Tools for Agents

Agents have access to these tools:

- `Bash` - Execute shell commands
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search file contents
- `LS` - List directory contents
- `Read` - Read file contents
- `Edit` - Edit files
- `MultiEdit` - Make multiple edits
- `Write` - Write files
- `NotebookRead` - Read Jupyter notebooks
- `NotebookEdit` - Edit Jupyter notebooks
- `WebFetch` - Fetch web content
- `TodoWrite` - Manage tasks
- `WebSearch` - Search the web
- `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` - Get IDE diagnostics
- `mcp__ide__executeCode` - Execute code in IDE
- `exit_plan_mode` - Exit planning mode

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Concurrent Execution**: Launch multiple agents in a single message for parallel execution
2. **Result Visibility**: Agent results are not visible to users - you must summarize findings
3. **Stateless Operation**: Each agent invocation is independent - provide complete instructions
4. **Trust Output**: Agent outputs are generally reliable
5. **Clear Instructions**: Specify whether the agent should write code or just research

## Examples

### Basic Keyword Search

```typescript
await Task({
	description: "Find logger usage",
	prompt: "Search the codebase for all uses of logging functionality. Find where loggers are created, configured, and used throughout the application. Return a list of files with logging usage and describe the logging patterns you find.",
})
```

### Architecture Investigation

```typescript
await Task({
  description: "Analyze auth system",
  prompt: "Investigate how authentication is implemented in this codebase. Look for:
  - Authentication middleware
  - Login/logout endpoints
  - Token generation and validation
  - Session management
  - User authorization logic
  Provide a comprehensive overview of the authentication architecture with file paths and key functions."
})
```

### Configuration Discovery

```typescript
await Task({
  description: "Find all configs",
  prompt: "Locate all configuration sources in this project including:
  - Configuration files (.env, .config, etc.)
  - Configuration modules or classes
  - Environment variable usage
  - Dynamic configuration loading
  - Default values and overrides
  List each configuration source, its purpose, and how it's used."
})
```

### Multiple Concurrent Searches

```typescript
// Launch multiple agents in parallel
await Promise.all([
	Task({
		description: "Find API routes",
		prompt: "Search for all API endpoint definitions, REST routes, GraphQL schemas, and request handlers. List them organized by module.",
	}),
	Task({
		description: "Find database code",
		prompt: "Locate all database-related code including models, schemas, migrations, queries, and database connection configuration.",
	}),
	Task({
		description: "Find test files",
		prompt: "Find all test files, test utilities, mocks, and test configuration. Identify the testing frameworks used.",
	}),
])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Detailed Prompts**: Provide specific instructions about what to find and how to report it
2. **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the boundaries of the search
3. **Output Format**: Specify how you want results organized
4. **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group related searches for efficiency
5. **Summary Generation**: Always create a user-friendly summary of agent findings

## Common Patterns

### Pattern Investigation

```typescript
await Task({
  description: "Find pattern usage",
  prompt: "Search for uses of the Observer pattern in this codebase. Look for:
  - Event emitters and listeners
  - Publish/subscribe implementations
  - Callback registrations
  - Event dispatching mechanisms
  Explain how each implementation works and where it's used."
})
```

### Dependency Analysis

```typescript
await Task({
  description: "Analyze dependencies",
  prompt: "Find all external library dependencies and how they're used. For each major dependency:
  - List where it's imported
  - Describe its purpose
  - Show example usage
  Focus on runtime dependencies, not dev dependencies."
})
```

## ✅ Implementation Notes - REAL AI AGENTS

### **Real AI Agent Architecture**

- **LLM Integration**: Agents use actual Claude/GPT models with real reasoning capabilities
- **Isolated Execution**: Agents run in secure sandboxes with resource limits
- **Worker Threads**: True parallel execution with in-process fallback
- **Maximum Execution**: 5-minute timeout with graceful handling
- **Security**: Read-only by default unless write permissions explicitly granted
- **Results**: Real AI analysis aggregated and summarized before returning

### **Model Configuration**

- **Default Model**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (optimized for speed and tool use)
- **Provider Support**: 23+ LLM providers through Zentara's existing infrastructure
- **Token Tracking**: Real token usage monitoring and reporting
- **Streaming**: Live response streaming with real-time progress updates

### **Production Capabilities**

- **API Integration**: Full integration with existing Zentara LLM handlers
- **Real Tool Execution**: Agents can actually use tools and analyze results
- **Autonomous Reasoning**: Actual AI decision-making for complex tasks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking and resource usage

## Error Handling

The Task tool handles various error scenarios:

- Agent timeout: Returns partial results with timeout indication
- Tool failures: Continues with other tools, reports failures
- No results found: Returns empty findings with clear message
- Resource limits: Gracefully degrades when hitting limits

## Performance Considerations

- Agents run concurrently up to a system-defined limit
- Results are cached within the agent's execution
- Use specific tools (Glob, Grep) for simple, targeted searches
- Reserve Task tool for complex, exploratory searches

## 🚀 **Transformation: From Simulation to Real AI**

### **Before (Simulation)**

```
User Request → Task Tool → Hardcoded Responses ❌
- Fake analysis with predetermined outputs
- No actual reasoning or tool use
- Limited to scripted scenarios
```

### **After (Real AI Agents)**

```
User Request → Task Tool → Real LLM → Actual Analysis ✅
- Genuine AI reasoning with Claude/GPT models
- Real tool execution and result analysis
- Autonomous decision-making and exploration
- Dynamic responses based on actual findings
```
