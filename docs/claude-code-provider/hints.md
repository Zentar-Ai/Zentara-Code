Currently, llm-orc requires users to manually enter API keys for Anthropic authentication. However, research shows that it's possible to enable users to sign in directly with their existing Claude Pro/Max accounts using OAuth.

‚úÖ Research Status: COMPLETE
Investigation has successfully proven that OAuth authentication with Claude Pro/Max accounts is fully functional.

üî¨ Key Findings
OAuth Authentication Requirements
OAuth Bearer Token: Standard OAuth 2.0 access token with anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20 header
User-Agent Header: Any valid User-Agent string works (tested LLM-Orchestra/Python 0.3.0)
System Prompt: Must include "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude." for token validation
Client ID: Uses 9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e (registered with Anthropic)
‚úÖ Proven Working Implementation
OAuth Flow: Complete PKCE-based authorization working
Token Exchange: Successfully exchanges auth codes for access tokens
API Calls: Confirmed working with LLM-Orchestra/Python 0.3.0 User-Agent
Authentication Methods: No need to spoof OpenCode identity
üéØ Three Authentication Modes Available
API Key (existing): Direct Anthropic API key entry
OAuth (new): Claude Pro/Max account login via OAuth ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Claude CLI Fallback (planned): Use local claude command with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset

Role Flexibility: Financial analysts, marketing strategists, legal advisors, etc. using OAuth authentication

TDD Implementation: Complete test suite with 6 comprehensive test cases

Conversation Integration: Role establishment persists across conversation turns

Performance Optimization: Smart role injection (only when needed, no duplication)

Authentication Transparency: Users don't need to understand OAuth constraints
üîß Phase 5: Token Expiration Handling ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE

Graceful Token Refresh: Fixed OAuth token expiration in ensemble execution

Client ID Storage: Enhanced credential storage to include client_id for token refresh

Fallback Mechanism: Added hardcoded client_id fallback for anthropic-claude-pro-max

Backward Compatibility: Existing OAuth setups continue working with automatic fallback

Error Recovery: Eliminated "Token expired - refresh needed" errors in ensemble execution
Phase 6: Claude CLI Fallback

Implement ClaudeCLIModel class using subprocess calls to claude

Add environment variable management (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset)

Detect local Claude CLI installation

Add fallback selection logic when OAuth becomes unavailable
Phase 7: User Experience

Add authentication setup wizard for new users

Improve error messages for authentication failures

Add authentication status display in CLI

Update documentation with OAuth setup instructions

Add migration guide for existing API key users
üõ°Ô∏è Fallback Strategy
If Anthropic restricts the OAuth flow in the future, we have a proven fallback:

Use local claude CLI with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset
Assumes user has authenticated locally with claude auth login
Provides interface compatibility while using official Claude CLI
üîß Technical Implementation Notes
Required Headers for OAuth:

headers = {
"Authorization": f"Bearer {oauth_token}",
"anthropic-beta": "oauth-2025-04-20",
"User-Agent": f"LLM-Orchestra/Python {**version**}", # Dynamic version
"Content-Type": "application/json"
}
Required System Prompt:

system = "You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude."
Role Injection Implementation:

def \_inject_role_if_needed(self, role_prompt: str) -> None:
"""Inject role establishment into conversation if needed."""
oauth_system_prompt = (
"You are Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude."
)

    # Don't inject role if it's the OAuth system prompt itself
    if role_prompt == oauth_system_prompt:
        return

    # Don't inject role if already established with the same role
    if self._role_established and self._current_role == role_prompt:
        return

    # Inject role establishment
    role_message = f"For this conversation, please act as: {role_prompt}"
    self.add_to_conversation("user", role_message)

    # Add assistant acknowledgment
    acknowledgment = "Understood. I'll act in that role for our conversation."
    self.add_to_conversation("assistant", acknowledgment)

    # Mark role as established
    self._role_established = True
    self._current_role = role_prompt

Token Expiration Fix Implementation:

# Enhanced credential storage with client_id

def store_oauth_token(
self,
provider: str,
access_token: str,
refresh_token: str | None = None,
expires_at: int | None = None,
client_id: str | None = None, # Added for token refresh
) -> None:
if client_id:
credentials[provider]["client_id"] = client_id

# Ensemble execution with fallback client_id

client_id = oauth_token.get("client_id")
if not client_id and model_name == "anthropic-claude-pro-max":
client_id = "9d1c250a-e61b-44d9-88ed-5944d1962f5e" # Fallback
Priority: High - Significantly improves user onboarding
Effort: Medium - Core implementation proven, needs integration
Impact: High - Eliminates API key management friction
