**Tools**: `readFileTool.ts`, `writeToFileTool.ts`, `applyDiffTool.ts`, `insertContentTool.ts`
- **Architecture**: Comprehensive file manipulation with safety mechanisms
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-file reading with line range support (up to 5 files)
  - Surgical diff application with search/replace blocks
  - Write protection and access control
  - Content insertion at specific line positions
- **Safety Patterns**: Access validation, file existence checks, backup mechanisms

### 4. **Command Execution Tools** - *System Integration Layer*
**Primary Tool**: `executeCommandTool.ts`
- **Architecture**: Shell command execution with comprehensive error handling
- **Key Features**:
  - Shell integration error detection
  - Timeout management and process control
  - Working directory management

- **Key Features**:
  - Action-based interaction model (launch, click, type, scroll, close)
  - Coordinate-based element interaction
  - Screenshot and console log capture
  - Approval-based execution flow

### 6. **Search and Discovery Tools** - *Code Intelligence Layer*
**Tools**: `searchFilesTool.ts`, `listFilesTool.ts`, `globTool.ts`, `codebaseSearchTool.ts`

- **Key Features**:
  - Regex-based file content search with context
  - Directory traversal with filtering
  - Glob pattern matching
  - Code definition extraction
- **Performance**: Context-rich results with configurable output modes

### 7. **Workflow Management Tools** - *Task Orchestration Layer*
**Tools**: `newTaskTool.ts`, `switchModeTool.ts`, `updateTodoListTool.ts`, `attemptCompletionTool.ts`
- **Architecture**: Mode-based workflow control
- **Key Features**:
  - Task creation and mode switching
  - Todo list management with status tracking
  - Completion validation and result presentation
  - Cross-mode communication

### 8. **Utility and Helper Tools** - *Support Layer*
**Tools**: `fetchToolDescriptionTool.ts`, `fetchInstructionsTool.ts`, `validateToolUse.ts`
- **Architecture**: Self-documenting and validation systems
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic tool documentation retrieval
  - Instruction fetching for complex operations
  - Tool usage validation

## Integration Patterns and Common Interfaces

### 1. **Shared Message Architecture**
All tools implement a consistent message structure:
```typescript
{
  tool: string,
  path?: string,
  content?: string,
  // tool-specific properties
}
```

### 2. **Approval-Based Execution**
Critical tools implement approval workflows:
- `didApprove` boolean flags
- `completeMessage` objects with shared properties
- User confirmation before destructive operations

### 3. **Error Handling Patterns**
Consistent error handling across tools:
- Try-catch blocks with specific error types
- Formatted error messages with context
- Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms

### 4. **Provider Integration**
Tools integrate with the provider system:
- Provider access for configuration and state
- Diagnostic and telemetry integration
- Resource management and cleanup

### 5. **Validation Layer**
Multi-level validation system:
- Parameter validation at tool entry points
- Access control and permission checking
- Content validation and sanitization

## Architectural Strengths

### 1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
- Each tool has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Clear boundaries between different tool categories
- Minimal coupling between tool implementations

### 2. **Comprehensive LSP Integration**
