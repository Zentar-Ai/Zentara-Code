  1 | # CLAUDE.md
  2 | 
  3 | This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
  4 | 
  5 | ## Overview
  6 | 
  7 | Zentara Code is a VS Code extension that serves as an AI-powered coding assistant with integrated runtime debugging capabilities. It's a fork of Roo-Code enhanced with Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) debugging features.
  8 | 
  9 | ## What you should do when there is an error:
 10 | 
 11 | When you see an error or when user ask you to resolve an error, debug a problem, always call ultra-debugger to help with debugging
 12 | 
 13 | ## Development Commands
 14 | 
 15 | ### Initial Setup
 16 | 
 17 | ```bash
 18 | # Install pnpm globally if not already installed
 19 | npm install -g pnpm
 20 | 
 21 | # Install dependencies (uses pnpm workspaces)
 22 | pnpm install
 23 | 
 24 | # Install tsx globally for TypeScript debugging
 25 | npm install -g tsx
 26 | ```
 27 | 
 28 | ### Build Commands
 29 | 
 30 | ```bash
 31 | # Build all packages in the monorepo
 32 | pnpm build
 33 | 
 34 | # Watch mode for development (builds webview, bundles extension, and watches TypeScript)
 35 | pnpm watch
 36 | 
 37 | # Bundle the extension only
 38 | cd src && pnpm bundle
 39 | 
 40 | # Package the extension into .vsix file
 41 | pnpm vsix
 42 | ```
 43 | 
 44 | ### Testing and Quality Commands
 45 | 
 46 | ```bash
 47 | # Run all tests across the monorepo
 48 | pnpm test
 49 | 
 50 | # Run linting
 51 | pnpm lint
 52 | 
 53 | # Check TypeScript types
 54 | pnpm check-types
 55 | 
 56 | # Format code
 57 | pnpm format
 58 | 
 59 | # Run tests for a specific package
 60 | pnpm --filter @roo-code/[package-name] test
 61 | ```
 62 | 
 63 | ### Development Workflow
 64 | 
 65 | 1. Use VS Code's "Run Extension" (F5) to launch a development instance
 66 | 2. The `watch` task automatically rebuilds on file changes
 67 | 3. For debugging the extension itself, use the launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`
 68 | 
 69 | ## Architecture Overview
 70 | 
 71 | ### Monorepo Structure
 72 | 
 73 | The project uses pnpm workspaces with Turbo for build orchestration:
 74 | 
 75 | - `/src` - Main VS Code extension code
 76 | - `/webview-ui` - React-based sidebar UI
 77 | - `/packages/*` - Shared packages (cloud, types, telemetry, ipc)
 78 | - `/apps/*` - Additional applications (nightly builds, web evals)
 79 | 
 80 | ### Core Extension Architecture
 81 | 
 82 | #### AI Provider Integration (`/src/api`)
 83 | 
 84 | Zentara Code integrates with multiple AI providers through a unified interface:
 85 | 
 86 | - Each provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, etc.) implements the common API interface
 87 | - Streaming responses are handled uniformly across providers
 88 | - Authentication and configuration are managed per provider
 89 | 
 90 | 
 91 | #### Tool System (`/src/core/tools`)
 92 | 
 93 | Tools enable the AI to interact with the development environment:
 94 | 
 95 | - File operations (read, write, edit, search)
 96 | - Terminal command execution
 97 | - Browser automation
 98 | - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
 99 | - Debugging operations (31 specialized debug tools)
100 | 
101 | 
102 | 
103 | 
104 | 4. AI can perform sophisticated debugging operations like conditional breakpoints and expression evaluation
105 | 
106 | ## Important Patterns
107 | 
108 | 1. **Async/Await Everywhere**: All I/O operations use async patterns
109 | 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Debug events, file changes, and UI updates use EventEmitter
110 | 3. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating provider instances and debug trackers
111 | 4. **Dependency Injection**: Core services are injected rather than imported directly
112 | 5. **State Management**: React Context for UI state, controller classes for extension state
113 | 
114 | ## Testing Strategy
115 | 
116 | - Unit tests use Vitest with mocks for VS Code APIs
117 | - Integration tests use VS Code's test framework
118 | - Debug functionality tests use real debug sessions with test files in `/testdata`
119 | - Each package has its own test configuration
120 | 
121 | 
122 | 
123 | REMEMBER HOW YOU SHOULD DO:
124 | -Always think about best coding practice, follow the DRY, KISS and other best practices that big tech company follow
125 | -Keep files small, less than 500 lines. 
126 | - Always reflect if your solution is the most optimal in both of time and memory complexity. Think like when you solve leetcode problems.

 [Extension Host] [subtasks] finishing subtask Based on my analysis of the root-level files, here's what I've discovered about this project:

## Project Overview

**Zentara Code** (formerly Roo Code) is a sophisticated AI-powered VS Code extension that serves as an autonomous coding assistant with integrated debugging capabilities. It's a fork of Roo-Code enhanced with Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) debugging features.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript** - Primary language for the extension
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **React** - For the webview UI components
- **pnpm** - Package manager with workspace support
- **Turbo** - Build system orchestration
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **ESBuild** - Bundling and asset generation

### Monorepo Structure
The project uses a **pnpm workspace** monorepo with **Turbo** for build orchestration:

- `/src` - Main VS Code extension code
- `/webview-ui` - React-based sidebar UI
- `/packages/*` - Shared packages (cloud, types, telemetry, ipc, evals)
- `/apps/*` - Additional applications (VSCode E2E tests, web docs, web evals, nightly builds)
- `/docs/` - Documentation
- `/locales/` - Internationalization files

### Key Features
1. **AI Provider Integration** - Supports multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, etc.)
2. **Advanced Tool System** - 31+ specialized tools including debugging operations
3. **Multiple Modes** - Architect, Code, Ask, Debug, Test, etc.
4. **Custom Instructions & Modes** - Extensible personality system
5. **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol for external tool integration
6. **Browser Automation** - Puppeteer-controlled browser interactions
7. **Debug Adapter Protocol** - Integrated runtime debugging capabilities

### Development Workflow
- Uses VS Code's extension development framework
- Hot reload during development (F5 to launch)
- Comprehensive testing with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Automated CI/CD with changesets for versioning
- Multi-language support with localization

## Project Purpose

Zentara Code is designed to be a comprehensive AI coding assistant that can:
- Generate and refactor code autonomously
- Debug applications with sophisticated breakpoint management
- Execute terminal commands and browser automation
- Integrate with various AI providers and external tools
- Adapt its behavior through custom modes and instructions
- Work across multiple programming languages and frameworks

The project represents a significant advancement in AI-powered development tools, combining code generation, debugging, and automation capabilities in a single VS Code extension. (cancelledByUser: false)

 [Extension Host] [subtasks] finishing subtask # Roo Code Packages Analysis

## List of All Packages (7 total):

1. **@roo-code/types** - Core type definitions
2. **@roo-code/cloud** - Cloud services integration
3. **@roo-code/ipc** - Inter-process communication
4. **@roo-code/telemetry** - Analytics and telemetry
5. **@roo-code/evals** - Evaluation and testing framework
6. **@roo-code/config-eslint** - Shared ESLint configuration
7. **@roo-code/config-typescript** - Shared TypeScript configuration

## Purpose of Each Package:

### Core Packages:
- **@roo-code/types**: Provides shared TypeScript type definitions using Zod for validation. Acts as the foundation for type safety across the monorepo.
- **@roo-code/cloud**: Handles cloud services integration with Redis, Socket.IO, and JWT functionality for remote Roo Code access.
- **@roo-code/ipc**: Manages inter-process communication using node-ipc for remote Roo Code access between processes.
- **@roo-code/telemetry**: Handles analytics and telemetry collection using PostHog for usage tracking and metrics.
- **@roo-code/evals**: Comprehensive evaluation and testing framework with database support (PostgreSQL/SQLite), Redis integration, and CLI tools for running code evaluations.

### Configuration Packages:
- **@roo-code/config-eslint**: Shared ESLint configuration with support for base, React, and Next.js configurations.
- **@roo-code/config-typescript**: Shared TypeScript configuration settings for consistent compilation across projects.

## Dependencies Between Packages:

### Dependency Hierarchy:
```
@roo-code/types (foundation)
├── @roo-code/cloud (depends on types)
├── @roo-code/ipc (depends on types)  
├── @roo-code/telemetry (depends on types)
└── @roo-code/evals (depends on types + ipc)

@roo-code/config-eslint (shared by all)
@roo-code/config-typescript (shared by all)
```

### Key Dependencies:
- **@roo-code/types**: No internal dependencies (foundation package)
- **@roo-code/cloud**: Depends on `@roo-code/types`
- **@roo-code/ipc**: Depends on `@roo-code/types`
- **@roo-code/telemetry**: Depends on `@roo-code/types`
- **@roo-code/evals**: Depends on both `@roo-code/types` and `@roo-code/ipc`
- **Configuration packages**: Used as devDependencies by all other packages for consistent linting and TypeScript setup

The architecture follows a clean dependency pattern where `@roo-code/types` serves as the foundational package, and other packages build upon it while maintaining separation of concerns for cloud services, IPC, telemetry, and evaluation functionality. (cancelledByUser: false)

<subagent>
{
    "description": "Analyze code",
    "message": "Analyze the TypeScript files in /src directory"
}
</subagent>

<!-- Multiple parallel subagents -->
<subagent>
[
    {"description": "Test backend", "message": "Run backend unit tests"},
    {"description": "Test frontend", "message": "Run frontend tests"},
    {"description": "Lint code", "message": "Run ESLint checks"}
]
</subagent>
```

#### Development Workflow:
```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 20.19.2, PNPM 10.8.1
pnpm install
pnpm run bootstrap
pnpm run dev          # Start development mode
pnpm run build        # Build all packages
pnpm run test         # Run all tests
pnpm run package      # Create VSIX package
```
