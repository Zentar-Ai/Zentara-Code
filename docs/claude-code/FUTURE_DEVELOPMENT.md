# Future Development - Advanced Agent Capabilities

This document contains advanced features that could be implemented in future phases but are not part of the current implementation plan.

## Phase 4: Advanced Agent Capabilities (Future)

### 4.1 Multi-Agent Coordination

- **Objective**: Enable multiple autonomous agents to work together on complex tasks
- **Build on**: Enhanced Task system and agent infrastructure from Phases 1-3
- **Implementation**:
    - Agent-to-agent communication protocols
    - Task delegation and coordination systems
    - Conflict resolution for concurrent agent operations
    - Resource sharing and allocation between agents

### 4.2 Extended Thinking and Reasoning

- **Objective**: Implement advanced reasoning capabilities for autonomous agents
- **Build on**: Existing Task thinking patterns and agent decision-making
- **Implementation**:
    - Multi-step reasoning with intermediate result validation
    - Dynamic strategy adjustment based on intermediate results
    - Error recovery and alternative approach selection
    - Learning from previous task executions

### 4.3 Agent Performance Optimization

- **Objective**: Optimize agent performance and resource utilization
- **Build on**: All previous agent enhancements and tool optimizations
- **Implementation**:
    - Intelligent tool selection based on task context
    - Caching and reuse of previous agent results
    - Performance monitoring and optimization feedback
    - Resource limit enforcement and optimization

## Why These Are Future Features

These features represent advanced AI capabilities that would require:

- Complex machine learning components
- Sophisticated agent communication protocols
- Advanced reasoning systems
- Performance optimization algorithms

They build upon the foundation established in Phases 1-3 but represent a significant increase in complexity and are better suited for future development cycles.

## Current Focus

The immediate implementation focuses on:

- Phase 5: Agent-Driven Interactive Features (Slash commands, Hooks, UI)
- Phase 6: Agent System Integration and Polish (MCP, Documentation, Release)

These phases provide immediate value to users while establishing the foundation for future advanced capabilities.
